chef
====

chef based common project that other chef-specific projects should extend.


Continuous Integration
----------------------


Usage
-----

**1. Create a new cookbook**

```
$ rake new_cookbook
```

For example:

```
$ rake new_cookbook[test]
```
This will create a `test` cookbook into `main-cookbooks` path.

```
$ rake new_cookbook[test, main-cookbooks]
```
This will create a `test` cookbook into `main-cookbooks` path.

**2. Build cookbooks**

```
$ rake build
```
This will check all cookbooks under `main-cookbooks` path with: `knife_test`, `foodcritic` and
`chefspec`

For more tasks, refer to `Rakefile`.
